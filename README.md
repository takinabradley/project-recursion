### Two quick recursion projects.

## fibsList:
A function that returns the fibbonocci sequence as an array up to the number specified. Includes both a recursive and an iterative version.

## mergeSort: 
A recursive merge-sort algorithm that sorts a given array.
There's an iterative version, but it sucks.
